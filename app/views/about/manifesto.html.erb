            <p class="align-center">When we started this project a couple of months ago, we had one goal; To learn the basics of Ruby on Rails in order to expand our horizons and learn new technologies as developers are wont do to. The firsts iterations of the app were quite austere and simple in fact you, reader mine, may want to see it for yourself <%= link_to "here", 'https://recipefinder1786.herokuapp.com/',{ :class=>"a-gold" } %>. But as we learned more about the Rails and we invested time and effort into this project we came to a conclusion.</p>

            <p class="align-center">The app had potential, yes it wasn't going to be the Facebook of cooking recipes but it had a lot to offer for those who want to easily search new recipes to cook. It is fast, lightweight and simple to use, so why not take it a step further? After all what is the point of all this effort if we don’t have anything to show for it, something to look back and shake our heads at years down the road when we see how it all started.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p class="message">"This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a motherfucking Tamagotchi."</p>
              <cite>So what did we learn?</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <p class="align-center">When we were starting out, we didn’t know Ruby or Rails and could do what Java or .NET did in our sleep. We budgeted 2 weeks to play around with Rails and if we were still as frustrated after 2 weeks as we were day one, we’d switch to Java. In those two weeks, we had built so much functionality there was no reason to go back. The high amount of developer productivity is huge.</p>

            <p class="align-center">Of course, the switch was sometimes challenging — we had to learn a lot of new concepts. But the number of work-hours we’ve saved from doing so has easily justified the inversion.</p>
            
            <p class="align-center">The reality is, a good developer should be flexible enough to pick up a new framework or language in a couple of weeks. The decision on which tools you use to build your product should be based on how effectively they enable you to achieve your business goals. After all the good practices and conventions of software engineering are universal.</p>
